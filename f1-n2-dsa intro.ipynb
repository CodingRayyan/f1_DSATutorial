    "###\n",
    "A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to make it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Family Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a family tree. It helps organize information about family members and their relationships, making it easy to find someone, like \"Who is my grandmother?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are Data Structures Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They help manage large data efficiently (e.g., databases, search engines).\n",
    "- They are key to building fast and effective algorithms.\n",
    "- They reduce complexity and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Structures in Computer Science:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primitive Data Structures: Basic types like integers, floats, characters, and booleans.\n",
    "- Abstract Data Structures: More advanced structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, built using primitive types for complex tasks."
